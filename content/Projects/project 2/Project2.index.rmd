# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
glimpse(approval_polllist)

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.


```{r}
approval_polllist$week_number <- week(approval_polllist$enddate)
approval_polllist$net_approve <- approval_polllist$approve - approval_polllist$disapprove
approval_polllist_summary <- summarySE(approval_polllist, measurevar="net_approve", groupvars="week_number")
ggplot(approval_polllist_summary, aes(x=week_number, y=net_approve)) + geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat = "identity") + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=net_approve-ci, ymax=net_approve+ci), width=.2, position=position_dodge(.9))
```

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

```{r}
week_15_vs_week_34 <- approval_polllist %>% filter(week_number==15|week_number==34) 
glimpse(week_15_vs_week_34)
summarySE(week_15_vs_week_34, measurevar="net_approve", groupvars="week_number")
```
According to the data frame, the net approval went from -8.82 to -13.15 from week 15 to week 34, signifying that there has been a significant rise on disapproval on Trump administration. The declining net approval rate in week 34 can be linked to a series of social events and controversial Trump policies on covid, including authorising Plasma treatment amid attacks on FDA, uncontrollable California wildfire, the Louisiana shooting - another police killing of Black man which sparked local outrage and rising protests.
